Hi, I’m @apalmatier! I'm a SRE/Software Engineer at Quantum Metric by day, experimentor and gamer by night.

I’m interested in topics like CI/CD, Observability, and automation in any form. I enjoy any language that doesn't end in "Script", but mostly I stick to Python and GoLang nowadays.

I've become sufficiently good at Kubernetes and GCP, so now I need to get back to focusing on GoLang itself as it's been a while since I've written much code.

How to reach me best is reaching out on LinkedIn for professional topics https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexpalmatier/
