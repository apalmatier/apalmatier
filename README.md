Hi, I’m @apalmatier! I'm a SRE/Software Engineer/Whatever by day and sometimes night.

I’m interested in topics like CI/CD, Observability, and automation in any form.

I’m currently deep diving into the topics I work with daily. I've learned "enough" breadth for now and I think it's time to really dig into the things
I'm doing on a day-to-day basis. I've begun to master Kubernetes, the Grafana Stack, and GCP. I'm familiar with many other tech components, but mostly "as needed".

How to reach me best is reaching out on LinkedIn for professional topics, maybe some day I'll make a "junk" email for other things... I'm never on social
media, so don't bother looking.
